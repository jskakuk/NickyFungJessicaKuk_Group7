                    <p><strong>Co-founder</strong></p>
                    <p>My name is Angela and I’m one of the co-founders of Thoughts On!  Niks and I started playing around with glass etching the summer of 2014 when we came upon this Martha Stewart post on Pinterest and thought why not?! It summer, too hot to stay out and we were bored. Little did we know, that slice of curiosity has gotten us to where we are today. I’m a Business student at SFU with a minor in Publications. Growing up, I’ve always loved arts and crafts and scrapbooking has been a long time hobby of mine. With a Pub background and having taken a couple of design courses in school, I’ve began taking an interest in typography and this has definitely influenced the way I stencil my work. In my free time, when I’m not etching glass, painting canvases or going to school, I love to go play Bingo (yes, with cute old people at a bingo center; trust me, it is a lot more exciting than it sounds), cook and catching up on Grey’s Anatomy!

                    <p><strong>Co-founder</strong></p>
                    <p>My name is Niks and the other face of Thoughts On. I grew up in Alberta but moved to beautiful British Columbia when I was 10. I love anything that is fine arts related and although I have no education or experience in design, I am super excited to be working with Angela in delivering products that allow people express their thoughts. I have a degree in Market Research from BCIT and currently work a full time job at a tourism research lab. When I’m not at work, I love spending my time learning about design and typography. Thoughts On has given me the opportunity to venture out of my comfort zone and I can’t wait to do more of that all the fairs that are happening in the coming few months. Some of my favorites in life are: my dog Happy (English cocker spaniel), green tea Frappuccino (soy with no whip), and travelling (I’ve been to most places in Eastern Europe and the major countries in Asia)!
