                <p>First and foremost, thank you everyone for being such huge supporters of Thoughts On from the very beginning! We cannot express our gratitude for what this start-up business has become, and we definitely would not have been able to do this without the encouragement from family, friends, and you guys. <br><br>

                  Between juggling school, work, sleep, this business and everything in between, we want to take this time to share our blog with you so you can see what we have been up to! In here, we will talk about everything from events and fairs that are coming up, new products that are about to launch, and what inspires us and our creativity! We will keep you guys updated as often as we can, but meanwhile, read our first 2015 post to see what exiciting things are happening!</p>
