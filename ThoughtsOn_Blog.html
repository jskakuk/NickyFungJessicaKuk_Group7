                <p><strong>January 7, 2015</strong></p>

                <p>First and foremost, thank you everyone for being such huge supporters of Thoughts On since the start. Nicolle and I cannot express our gratefulness for what this little creation has become. We want to take this first blog post to count our blessings in 2014 and share our plans for 2015!</p>

                  <p><strong>Tears of joy comes with buckets of sweat</strong></p>

                    <p>This business has really made us realize the hard work and dedication that is required. We’ve stayed up endless nights to finish orders, contact costumers, plan for our fairs…the list just never seems to ends! However, taking a minute to look back at the past few months of starting this baby, we’ve realized that our little efforts day by day has paid off and made us grow rewardingly.
                    </p><br>
                  <p><strong>Here are some achievements in 2014:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><em>Showcasing at RBC Bank’s Small Business Month.</em></li>
                      <li><em>Winning the title of SFU’s Next Top Product.</em> This was such a humbling experience that Thoughts On was able to take on this title. A variety of our designed and hand etched glassware can be purchased at the SFU Bookstore on Burnaby Campus. Please check us out and support us! Our products are currently displayed on the bookshelves next to the cash registers on the top floor.</li>
                      <li><em>Vending at Christmas Craft Fairs in Vancouver.</em> Participating in both Britannia’s 31st Annual Christmas Craft Fair and SFU’s Student Society Winter Craft Fair was a huge success. With tons of support from all of you, we are looking forward to participating in more craft fairs and markets.</li>
                    </ul> <br>

                    <ul>
                      <li><em>Etsy Store.</em> Although some of our designs can be bought at the SFU Bookstore in Burnaby, we are going to establish more online presence through setting up an online store. In the meantime, please contact us at info@thoughtson.ca for any orders/inquiries!</li>
                      <li><em>New Crafted Products: cards, canvases, and so much more!</em> Although Thoughts On currently only offers glass etched products, we are working on expanding our product line. We view Thoughts On as a meaningful gift giving novelty company where our hand crafted products will give a priceless sentimental value.</li>
                      <li><em>Regular blogs.</em> As two crafters who are passionate in trying new crafts and living our lives to the fullest, we want to share our  creations and experiments with other DIYers out there.</li>
